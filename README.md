# Secure and Inspect Data in Amazon S3 Bucket

Welcome to the Secure and Inspect Data in Amazon S3 Bucket repository. This repository is used to store dummy database file that are used for a cybersecurity project using Amazon Marcie. 

All you have to do to proceed is to download these csv files. The files created with [Mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/) looks like exactly what you may get if you are dealing with data from a hospital database, thereby justifying what you may have in an HIPAA set up.

We will be using [Amazon Macie](https://aws.amazon.com/macie/) to discover these data which will be stored in an S3 Bucket and also protect them.

We will also extend the capabilities of this by using some regex expression to dig in more into the data that is being stored by the S3 bucket.

The impact of this is that we in the field of cybersecurity needs to be mindful about the data, why? because data is the gold we tend to protect in this domain.

Here comes the AWS Macie which could stand as a constant monitoring service to this data. Finding pattern matching, performing scans and finally generating the findings which will be sent for further remediation.

A full technical description of how this service was implemented can be found in my [blog](https://medium.com/@Los-merengue/securing-data-in-aws-using-marcie-a2e540608dae)

Thank you!
